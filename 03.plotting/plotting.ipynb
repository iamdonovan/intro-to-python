    "\n",
    "`seaborn` has a number of different functions that accomplish the same thing in different ways. So far, we have seen a few different examples of functions that create plots (e.g., `scatterplot`, `histplot`, `boxplot`, etc.). The output of these functions, as we have noted above, is an **Axes** object. Inside of a script, these functions will draw the plot within the \"currently active\" **Axes** object, or inside of whatever **Axes** object you pass to the function using the `ax` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than using these axes-level functions, we can also use figure-level plots, which create their own **Figure** object before drawing the plot. To see a simple example of this, let's draw a scatter plot using `sns.relplot()` ([documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.relplot.html)):"
